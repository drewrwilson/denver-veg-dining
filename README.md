A list of some good vegetarian-friendly places to eat in Denver, Colorado.

The idea is to have a simple list of restaurants so anyone can find a good place find the best vegetarian dining in Denver. It would be even better if:
 * Users could sort the list based on some tags like, "all vegetarian", etc
 * The content can be easily updated by non-technical users.
 * It used HTML5 geo lat/long stuff to give someone the nearest place to them, etc.
